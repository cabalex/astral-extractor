# [astral-extractor](https://cabalex.github.io/astral-extractor/index.html)
 A web based, client-side extractor that allows for easy extracting and editing of Astral Chain's files.
 Supports many file types, including model previews (WMB)- However, for model editing, use [AstralChain2Blender](https://github.com/cabalex/AstralChain2Blender) and [Blender2AstralChain](https://github.com/cabalex/Blender2AstralChain).

You don't need to download anything to get it working- just [open it in your modern-ish browser](https://cabalex.github.io/astral-extractor/index.html).
